# Hospital Service

![Hospital Service](hospital.png)

Hospital Service is a project built with Go (Golang) that provides a REST API for client communication and a GRPC server for inter-service communication. It aims to manage various aspects of a hospital, including appointments, doctors, patients, employees, schedules, and the overall hospital information.

## Features

- **Appointments**: Manage and schedule appointments between doctors and patients.
- **Doctors**: Maintain a list of doctors, their specialties, and other related information.
- **Patients**: Keep track of patient records, including personal details, medical history, and appointments.
- **Employees**: Manage the hospital's employees, including doctors, nurses, and administrative staff.
- **Schedules**: Maintain schedules for doctors, ensuring efficient allocation of their time.
- **Hospital**: Store general information about the hospital, such as its name, address, contact details, etc.

## Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **REST API**: The REST API acts as the client-facing interface, allowing external clients to interact with the hospital service. It provides endpoints for CRUD operations on various entities, such as appointments, doctors, patients, employees, and hospital information.
- **GRPC Server**: The GRPC server handles inter-service communication within the hospital service. It exposes RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods that can be consumed by other services within the system.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used in this project includes:

- **Go**: The primary programming language used for building the backend.
- **REST API**: The REST API is built using the Go standard library or popular frameworks like Gin or Echo.
- **GRPC**: The GRPC server is implemented using the Go GRPC library, enabling efficient communication between services.
- **Database**: The project utilizes a suitable database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB) for persisting data.
- **Docker**: Containerization using Docker facilitates easy deployment and scalability.
